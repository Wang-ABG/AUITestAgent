# testrespAI SDK
The AI SDK is a TypeScript toolkit designed to help you build AI-powered applications using popular frameworks like Next.js, React, Svelte, Vue and runtimes like Node.js.

To learn more about how to use the AI SDK, check out our API Reference and Documentation.

Installation
You will need Node.js 18+ and pnpm installed on your local development machine.

npm install ai
Usage
AI SDK Core
The AI SDK Core module provides a unified API to interact with model providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more.

You will then install the model provider of your choice.

npm install @ai-sdk/openai
@/index.ts (Node.js Runtime)
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'; // Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  system: 'You are a friendly assistant!',
  prompt: 'Why is the sky blue?',
});

console.log(text);
AI SDK UI
The AI SDK UI module provides a set of hooks that help you build chatbots and generative user interfaces. These hooks are framework agnostic, so they can be used in Next.js, React, Svelte, Vue, and SolidJS.

@/app/page.tsx (Next.js App Router)
'use client';

import { useChat } from 'ai/react';

export default function Page() {
  const { messages, input, handleSubmit, handleInputChange, isLoading } =
    useChat();

  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map(message => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          <div>{message.role}</div>
          <div>{message.content}</div>
        </div>
      ))}

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          value={input}
          placeholder="Send a message..."
          onChange={handleInputChange}
          disabled={isLoading}
        />
      </form>tions for different use cases, p
    </div>
  );
}
@/app/api/chat/route.ts (Next.js App Router)
import { streamText } from 'ai';roviders, and 
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();
frameworks. You 
  const result = streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-4o'),
    system: 'You are a helpful assistant.',can use these templates
    messages,
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse(); to get started with you
}
